Discover the benefits and challenges of this approach.","content":"# Building Scalable Micro Frontends with Single SPA\n\nMicro frontends have become increasingly popular as applications grow in complexity and teams expand. Single SPA is a powerful framework that enables you to build micro frontends that can coexist and communicate effectively.\n\n## What are Micro Frontends?\n\nMicro frontends are an architectural style where frontend applications are composed of independent, deployable applications. Each micro frontend can be developed, tested, and deployed independently by different teams.\n\n## Benefits of Single SPA\n\n- **Independent Development**: Teams can work on different micro frontends simultaneously\n- **Technology Diversity**: Different micro frontends can use different frameworks\n- **Scalability**: Easier to scale teams and applications\n- **Maintenance**: Smaller, focused codebases are easier to maintain\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Setup Single SPA Root Config**\n2. **Create Micro Frontend Applications**\n3. **Configure Routing and Communication**\n4. **Deploy and Monitor**\n\nThis approach has revolutionized how we build large-scale frontend applications.","date":"2024-01-15","readTime":"8 min read","category":"Architecture","author":"Dilip Singh","slug":"micro-frontends-single-spa","featured":true,"tags":["Micro Frontends","Single SPA","Architecture","Scalability"],"published":true,"createdAt":"2024-01-15T10:00:00Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-15T10:00:00Z","__v":0,"id":"68ac0b019a99de78030223d2"},{"_id":"68ac0b019a99de78030223d3","title":"Integrating AI/ML in Modern Web Applications","excerpt":"A comprehensive guide to integrating AI and machine learning capabilities in React and Next.js applications.

From chatbots to recommendation systems, AI/ML integration is becoming essential for modern applications.\n\n## Popular AI/ML Libraries\n\n- **TensorFlow.js**: For browser-based machine learning\n- **OpenAI API**: For natural language processing\n- **Hugging Face**: For pre-trained models\n- **Clarifai**: For image recognition\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\n### 1. Chatbot Integration\n```javascript\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,\n});\n\nconst response = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n  model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  messages: [{ role: \"user\", content: \"Hello!\" }],\n});\n```\n\n### 2. Image Recognition\n```javascript\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';\n\nconst model = await tf.loadLayersModel('model.json');\nconst prediction = model.predict(imageTensor);\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Start with simple implementations\n- Use pre-trained models when possible\n- Implement proper error handling\n- Consider performance implications\n- Ensure data privacy and security\n\nAI/ML integration opens up endless possibilities for creating intelligent, user-friendly applications.","date":"2024-01-10","readTime":"12 min read","category":"AI/ML","author":"Dilip Singh","slug":"ai-ml-web-applications","featured":true,"tags":["AI/ML","React","Next.js","OpenAI","TensorFlow"],"published":true,"createdAt":"2024-01-10T10:00:00Z","updatedAt":"2024-01-10T10:00:00Z","__v":0,"id":"68ac0b019a99de78030223d3"}],"total":2}
